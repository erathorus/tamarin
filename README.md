# Tamarin â€” persistent end-to-end encrypted chat app

Tamarin makes it possible to have end-to-end encrypted conversations while persisting messages, unlike Whatsapp or Telegram where old messages cannot be retrieved. The tradeoff is that users have to store and share encryption keys by themselves.

# Features
